# Hello Neighbor Games Remake

## About the project
Hello Neighbor Games Remake (formerly HN Alpha 1 Kit) is a fan game based on [Hello Neighbor](https://www.helloneighborgame.com/). It contains different versions of Hello Neighbor as well as Angry Neighbor. We're moving away from the standard trailers, versions, and so on and trying to make something of our own by crossing, adding, and removing.
